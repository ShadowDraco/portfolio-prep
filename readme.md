# An performer, a developer

## Whatever "performer" refers to, its me

- From the various trials in Software development, amongst many programming challenges, making an impact in a team, or even capturing an audience from a stage. I am a performer. As a man after God I will use these skills to bring results

### Pitch

> I'm Ethan, I'm am a full-stack software developer. I have the skills to build great websites from scratch, or incorporate myself into a group. I have the intrinsic motivation to enable my success in any environment as a developer, an artist, and a servant of God. I've worked with people who make unity difficult and made an effective team out of them. I work extremely well with others when put into any role or position, and I work just as great alone. Much of my work experience has been completing big tasks with little support, and utmost consistency, so my goals in a team are always to work well with others regardless of how they think and act, and to be of good service in any role I take. I've accomplished various things among the arts and technology sides of the world giving me great perseverance while keeping me humble even in my best work. Practicing for months for a performance is hard work and building apps for my church or even for fun is also quite involved. I love it though, and I have been dancing and writing code for many years and enjoy the experience and content I can create from both! I can build an app that utilizes industry best practices and state of the art tools, servers, security, and visuals, and I use what is available to me to create as efficiently and effectively as possible. -- One minute

Aligning myself with the goals and vision of my team is important. I'm very capable of learning, teaching, problem solving, organizing projects and goals to keep my team on track. My work ethic, and growth mindset, leverage my skills in web development making me capable and reliable in the position that I am given. -- One minute Fifteen

### Technology is fascinating

- As I've learned to code in multiple languages, patterns, and for many reasons I have seen things that were only child-hood dreams become functional apps. Creating my own game, diving into serious video editing/content creation, and even deploying a secure website with whatever purpose I decide from MMO to shopping centre is available to me because of the skills ive gained.
