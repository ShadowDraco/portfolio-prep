# An performer, a developer

## Whatever "performer" refers to, its me

- From the various trials in Software development, amongst many programming challenges, making an impact in a team, or even capturing an audience from a stage. I am a performer. As a man after God I will use these skills to bring results

### Pitch

> I am a full-stack software developer. I have the skills to build a great website from scratch from just an idea, or incorporate myself into a group. I have great intrinsic motivation that enables me succeed in any environment as a developer, an artist, and a servant of God. I can build an app that utilizes industry best practices and state of the art tools, servers, security, and visuals in a short time. I can use what is available to me to create efficiently and effectively. I work extremely well with others when put into any role or position, and I work just as great alone

### Technology is fascinating

- As I've learned to code in multiple languages, patterns, and for many reasons I have seen things that were only child-hood dreams become functional apps. Creating my own game, diving into serious video editing/content creation, and even deploying a secure website with whatever purpose I decide from MMO to shopping centre is available to me because of the skills ive gained.
