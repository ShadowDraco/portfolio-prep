# An performer, a developer

## Whatever "performer" refers to, its me

- From the various trials in Software development, amongst many programming challenges, making an impact in a team, or even capturing an audience from a stage. I am a performer. As a man after God I will use these skills to bring results

### Pitch

> I am a full-stack software developer. I have the skills to build a great website from scratch, or incorporate myself into a group. I have great intrinsic motivation that enables me succeed in any environment as a developer, an artist, and a servant of God. I can build an app that utilizes industry best practices and state of the art tools, servers, security, and visuals in a short time. I use what is available to me to create efficiently and effectively. I work extremely well with others when put into any role or position, and I work just as great alone. I excel at bringing concepts to life, and do great to expand upon existing work. My goals in a team are always to work well with others regardless of how they think and act, and to be of good service in any role I take. Aligning myself with the goals and vision of my team is important, and I want feedback so that jobs are done well and products to be finished. I'm very capable of learning, as well as teaching using resources available. I'm good at problem solving, making sense of abstract information, as well as keeping goals and projects organized to turn daunting tasks into feasible projects.

### Technology is fascinating

- As I've learned to code in multiple languages, patterns, and for many reasons I have seen things that were only child-hood dreams become functional apps. Creating my own game, diving into serious video editing/content creation, and even deploying a secure website with whatever purpose I decide from MMO to shopping centre is available to me because of the skills ive gained.
